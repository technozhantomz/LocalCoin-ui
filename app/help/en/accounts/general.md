# Accounts

BitShares blockchain technology requires you
to register an account name to be able to use it. This comes with many advantages: Besides improved
scalability, BitShares Blockchain has separated the identity from the transaction authorizing
signature. In practice, *owning an account name* is independent from being able
to *spend its funds*. Furthermore, both rights (*permissions*) can
split among an arbitrary complex relation of people (*authorities*)
using *weights* and a required *thresholds*.
